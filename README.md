 - Open Android Studio.
 - Open the Project by navigating to the downloaded folder.
 - Wait for the project to build.

### Updating your Forked Repo
 - Regularly update your forked repository with the main repository.
 - This ensures that your repository does not miss the updated code from the main repository.

### Claiming Open Issues
 - Get yourself an issue assigned by claiming an Open Issue.
 - Issues would be assigned on a first come first serve basis.
 - An Issue would not be assigned if a participant has 2 assigned issues pending in the Repository.
 - There is no need to claim issues that are tagged `everyone` and anyone can work on those issues.

### Opening a New Issue
 - A participant may open a new issue if he gets an idea or finds a bug in the Original App.
 - The issue may/may not be accepted depending upon the type of Issue. 
 - If accepted, the points to these issues would be decided by the Mentor **only**.

### Creating a Pull Request
 - After working on the Issue assigned, create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
 - Use the [PR Template](https://github.com/opencodeiiita/Collaborative-App/blob/main/PR_Template.md) while creating a Pull Request. Note that the Pull Request must be in the same format as mentioned in the Template.
 - It is suggested to create a new branch for each pull request so that the work of a particular issue does not affect the other one.

## Guidelines and Best Practice

### Project specific guidelines.
1. We will not entertain any hard coded strings or colors etc. Please add the resource in the corrosponding xml.
2. Attach Screenshots or video (whichever applicable) with the PR.

### General Guidelines
1. People before code: If any of the following rules are violated, the pull-requests must not be rejected. This is to create an easy and joyful onboarding process for new programmers and first-time contributors.
2. Single commit per pull request and name the commit as something meaningful, example: Adding <-your-name-> in students/mentors section.
3. Reference the issue numbers in the commit message if it resolves an open issue. Follow the pattern Fixes #
4. Make a note to add relevent Screen Shots when you make a PR.
5.  Pull Request older than 3 days with no response from the contributor shall be marked closed.
6.  Do not make PR which is not related to any issues. You can create an issue and solve it once we approve them.
7.  Avoid duplicate PRs, if need be comment on the older PR with the PR number of the follow-up (new PR) and close the obsolete PR yourself.
8.  Be polite: Be polite to other community members.

Happy Coding!!
